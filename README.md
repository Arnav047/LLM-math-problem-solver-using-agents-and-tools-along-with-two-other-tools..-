# LLM-math-problem-solver-using-agents-and-tools-along-with-two-other-tools..-
this tools and agent project is different from the previous project (Building-Advanced-RAG-AGents-and-tools--With-Multiple-Data-Source-Using-Langchain)  


1Ô∏è‚É£ current project info:
(Streamlit-based Math and Wikipedia Assistant)

Objective: A chatbot that solves math problems and searches Wikipedia.
Tools:
WikipediaAPIWrapper: Directly queries Wikipedia and returns results.
LLMMathChain: A chain for solving math expressions using the LLM.
LLMChain: A custom-built chain for logic-based and reasoning questions.
Agent: Uses initialize_agent() with AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, which decides which tool to call based on the user‚Äôs query.
Interaction: Uses Streamlit‚Äôs chat interface (st.chat_message) and manages message history in st.session_state.
üëâ Approach:

A simple, interactive app where the agent decides between Wikipedia, math-solving, or reasoning.
Uses initialize_agent(), which is a high-level API for creating general-purpose agents.



2Ô∏è‚É£ previous project info:
(Advanced Search and Retrieval Agent)

Objective: A more advanced, information-retrieval-focused agent.

Tools:

WikipediaQueryRun: Another wrapper for Wikipedia but more customizable.

WebBaseLoader + FAISS: Loads web documents and creates a vector-based retrieval system.

ArxivQueryRun: Queries Arxiv for academic papers.

Retriever Tool: The FAISS vector store becomes a "tool" by using create_retriever_tool().

 create_openai_tools_agent:
Purpose: This function is specifically designed to create an agent that utilizes only OpenAI's function-calling capabilities. It's tailored for scenarios where the agent needs to interact with OpenAI's tools API, allowing the model to decide when and which functions to call based on the context.

Therefore here initialize_agent() can't be used

Agent: Uses create_openai_tools_agent() for tighter integration with OpenAI‚Äôs function-calling models.
Execution: Uses AgentExecutor for running the agent and its tools.
üëâ Approach:

A more sophisticated information retrieval system using vector search and academic databases.
Uses create_openai_tools_agent() for better performance with OpenAI‚Äôs tool-use capabilities.
